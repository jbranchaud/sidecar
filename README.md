# Sidecar

There is a Rails server and a create-react-app client.

First, follow the Rails server setup instructions for the
[`rails_server/README.md`](rails_server/README.md). Then launch the server
on port `3001`.

Second, launch the CRA client on port `3000`.

Then, visit [`localhost:3000`](http://localhost:3000) to interact with the
client interface of the app. Additionally, visit
[`localhost:3001/admin`](http://localhost:3001/admin) to access the
Rails-powered admin panel for the app.
